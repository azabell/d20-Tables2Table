================

A side-by-side coding comparison in (at least) perl, python, and ruby for translating two table-heavy funcitons into single-click results.

Long term, I'm hoping to transition Jamis Buck's excellent dnd-npc into (one or more of) these interpreted languages as an exercise to understand the language.
